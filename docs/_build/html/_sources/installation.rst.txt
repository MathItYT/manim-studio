Installation
============

Depending on your system, the installation process may vary.
We recomend reading `Manim's official documentation`_
first to install Manim.
Maybe you won't need to install LaTeX, because Manim Studio ships with MathJax Mobject.

.. _Manim's official documentation: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html

After installing Manim, you can install Manim Studio by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install manim-studio

Optionally, you can include the OpenAI API features. If so, instead of using the previous command,
you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install manim-studio[ai]

You're done! Now you can learn how to use Manim Studio at the :doc:`getting-started` section.
